# 🧬🔑 BioKey

BioKey is the cancer bioinformatics user registration and profile application.

It's to enable current and future users of [LabCAS](https://edrn-labcas.jpl.nasa.gov/) to help manage their identities, including:

- Registering for a non-[EDRN](https://edrn.nci.nih.gov/) account
- Updating your details, such as your email address or name
- Changing your non-EDRN password

👉 **Note:** If you have an account with EDRN (Early Detection Research Network), you can use it to access LabCAS and other EDRN applications. If you're not sure if you have an account, visit the [EDRN Data Management and Coordinating Center](https://www.compass.fhcrc.org/enterEDRN/) and try to log in. If you can't, you don't.
