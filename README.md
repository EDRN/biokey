# üß¨üîë BioKey

BioKey is the cancer bioinformatics user registration and profile application.

It's to enable current and future users of [LabCAS](https://edrn-labcas.jpl.nasa.gov/) to help manage their identities, including:

- Registering for a non-[EDRN](https://edrn.nci.nih.gov/) account
- Updating your details, such as your email address or name
- Changing your non-EDRN password

üëâ **Note:** If you have an account with EDRN (Early Detection Research Network), you can use it to access LabCAS and other EDRN applications. If you're not sure if you have an account, visit the [EDRN Data Management and Coordinating Center](https://www.compass.fhcrc.org/enterEDRN/) and try to log in. If you can't, you don't.


## ü§ì¬†Development

Make the DB

    createdb biokey
    ./manage.sh makemigrations
    ./manage.sh migrate wagtailimages  # not sure why this needs to be done separately
    ./manage.sh migrate

Maybe this is needed?

    ./manage.sh makemigrations --empty jpledrnbiokeystreams
    ./manage.sh makemigrations --empty jpledrnbiokeypolicy
    ./manage.sh makemigrations jpledrnbiokeycontent
    ./manage.sh makemigrations

Launch it

    ./manage.sh runserver 6468  # or pick your favorite port


### Essential Environment Variables

TBD.


### Database

### Software Installation

TBD.


## üö¢¬†Containerized Setup

TBD.

### üéë¬†Image Building

First, build the wheels by running:

    support/build-wheels.sh

Then build the image:

    docker image build --file docker/Dockerfile --tag edrndocker/biokey .

You can do a spot check to see if the image is viable by running

    docker container run --rm --env SIGNING_KEY=key --env ALLOWED_HOSTS='*' --publish 8000:8000 \
        edrndocker/biokey:latest

and then visiting http://localhost:8000/. If you get "Server Error (500)", congratulations! It's working.

To launch the orchestrated services (BioKey application, PostgreSQL database, Redis cache/message queue, and Celery worker)‚Äîor in other words, to _start the composition_‚Äîrun:

    docker compose --project-name biokey --file docker/docker-compose.yaml up --detach

Note the many environment variables that are needed. You'll want to put these into a `.env` file; see the "Environemnt Variables" section, below. Also, after the first launch only, the database is empty and needs to be structured and populated; see the next section.


### üìÄ¬†Containerized Database Setup

Create the `biokey` database in PostgreSQL:

    docker compose --project-name biokey --file docker/docker-compose.yaml \
        exec db createdb --username=postgres --encoding=UTF8 --owner=postgres biokey

Make sure the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variable has the same value when running this command as you did when you started the composition, above.

Next, run the Django database migrations to turn the empty `biokey` database into a Django-, Wagtail-, and BioKey-capable database:

    docker compose --project-name biokey --file docker/docker-compose.yaml \
        exec app /app/bin/django-admin migrate

Finally, populate the content with:

    docker compose --project-name biokey --file docker/docker-compose.yaml \
        exec app /app/bin/django-admin biokey_bloom
